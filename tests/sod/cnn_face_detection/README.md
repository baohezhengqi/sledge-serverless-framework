# CNN Face Detection

Originally, this workload returned an image where all the human faces were circles, along with the coordinates of the faces. It was modified to return a textual representation of faces, that is just the coordinates of the faces.

The scripts DO NOT check for functional correctness of output for this reason. Please look at other scripts to have a better example for new applications.
